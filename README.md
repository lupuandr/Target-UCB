# Target-UCB

targetUCB.py is a simple class implementing of the Target-UCB bandit algorithm, as introduced in the AAAI-19 technical paper _Leveraging observations in bandits: Between risks and benefits_.

To import the Target-UCB class, simply use the command "from targetUCB import TUCB".

An example of how to construct and test a clique of 4 Target-UCB agents is also provided. 
Executing the targetUCB.py file as a script will run this clique for 100 episodes on a two-armed bandit problem and display the cumulative regret of all 4 agents.
